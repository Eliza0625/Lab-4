                <h2> My Hobbies / Likes </h2>

                    <p id="p1"> Recently on my free time I've been really into playing <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/">Stardew Valley</a>... it's extremely addictive.. 
                                be very careful when playing that game. There's always things to do such as: </p>

                            <ul class="activities">
                                <li> Farming </li>
                                <li> Fishing</li>
                                <li> Mining</li>
                                <li> Romancing</li>
                            </ul>

                    <p>         Aside from Stardew Valley overtaking my time, I very much enjoy dog walking (it's not a free time thing, 
                                it's my job but I truly do enjoy spending the time with the dogs). I also enjoy laying down / napping, 
                                spending time with my boyfriend and just giving my body and mind some rest.  </p>
